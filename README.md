Linear Regression - Project

Congratulations, you received your first job with an ecommerce company from New York. This company sells clothing online but also offers clothing and style advice in stores. Customers can come to the store, consult with a stylist, and then buy the clothes they want through an app or website.

The company is in the process of deciding whether to focus on the app or website. Your job is to assist them with this decision.
